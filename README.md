# Modular Layouts in React

This is the tutorial code for my two part series **Modular Layouts in React**. You can visit these articles here:

-   [Modular Layouts in React Part 1](https://www.jeremysbarnes.com/blog/creating-modular-layouts-in-react-part-1)
-   [Modular Layouts in React Part 2](https://www.jeremysbarnes.com/blog/creating-modular-layouts-in-react-part-1)

Get started with each of these repositories:

-   [Part 1](#part-1-contents)
-   [Part 2](#part-2-contents)

## Overview:

Modular Layouts allow for quick, iterative content composition across your site. They abstract away the nuance of complex grid processes, and allow you to focus on creating engaging and responsive layouts.

## Part 1 Contents:

-   [Finish](part-1/finish)
    -   View the `final` code for part one's tutorial
-   [Examples](part-1/examples)
    -   View some of the `examples` from part one

## Part 1 Usage:

To see the final code for `part-1`, clone this repository and open it in your code editor. Next, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash

cd tutorials-modular-layouts-in-react
cd part-1
cd finish
yarn install
yarn start

```

You should see the following in your `localhost`:
